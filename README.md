# To-Do List Web Application

This is a simple web application for managing your to-do list. You can add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, filter tasks based on their completion status, delete tasks, and edit existing tasks. The application utilizes local storage to save and retrieve the tasks.

## Files

- **index.html**: The `index.html` file contains the template for the web page. It includes the necessary HTML structure for the to-do list application.

- **style.css**: The `style.css` file contains the CSS code that defines the visual styling and layout of the web page. It is responsible for the overall appearance of the application.

- **script.js**: The `script.js` file contains the JavaScript code that handles the logic and functionality of the to-do list application. It manages tasks, handles user interactions, and interacts with the browser's local storage.

## Usage

To use the web application, follow these steps:

1. Enter a task description in the input field and click the "Add" button to add the task to the list.

2. To mark a task as completed, check the checkbox next to the task. The task will be visually marked as completed.

3. Use the filter buttons ("All", "Completed", "Incomplete") to filter and display tasks based on their completion status.

4. To delete a task, click on the delete button (X) next to the task. The task will be removed from the list.

5. To edit an existing task, click on the edit button (pencil icon) next to the task. You can modify the task description and save the changes.

6. The tasks are automatically saved and retrieved from the browser's local storage. You can close the browser and reopen the application later to find your tasks preserved.

Please note that the web application requires a modern web browser with JavaScript enabled.
